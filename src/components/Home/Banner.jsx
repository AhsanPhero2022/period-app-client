      The menstrual cycle is the monthly process in which a woman's body prepares for pregnancy. It involves the shedding of the uterine lining and is controlled by hormones. <br/> <br/>

      <span className=''>
      The menstrual cycle is a natural process that occurs in women of reproductive age, typically lasting about 28 days although it may vary. It involves the release of an egg from the ovary, the thickening of the uterine lining, and the shedding of this lining if pregnancy does not occur.
